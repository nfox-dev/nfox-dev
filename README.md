## Hi there 👋

I'm Naviolet, a supposed cyberengineering student based in Malaysia.

A proud tech wizard doing anything to satisfy my boredom.

If an idea pops into my head, changes are I'll sacrifice my free time to build it, with undetermined quality.

My tech niche is messing with Linux and banging my head with C++ projects. (temporary)

Still looking for motivation to get myself working on my game project... :P Other than that, I got nothing to offer, as of now.

### Fun Fact
I take a sip of coffee before sleep
I enjoy linux distro, especially Arch and NixOS
